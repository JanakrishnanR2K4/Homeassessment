Students of your class were provided a google form by the Class representative to fill up some fields like their ids,etc. 
But now the CR is facing a problem in which some students have filled the form multiple times. 
CR extracted the ids from the forms and stored them in a numpy array.
As his friend he asked you for writing a program which takes a numpy array of ids as an input returns a numpy array of same length in which the first occurence of each id is replaced by False (implying that these are not duplicates) and the repetitions are replaced by True.
You won't leave your friend hanging. So try to help him here.
Input Format: number of test cases space separated integers as theelements of the array for each test case in a new line
Output Format: simply printed numpy array of True,False for each test case in a new line
Sample Input: 1 0 0 3 0 2 4 2 2 2 2 Sample Output: [False True False True False False True True True True] Note: Here the numpy array is simply
printed without any formatting and the code for taking input is already written.
Here you are expected to use numpy functions especially np.unique(), try to search about their use and do use them in the question
